# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The petting zoo directory website is experiencing critical runtime errors that cause the application to crash and display an error page after loading briefly. The errors are primarily null reference exceptions where components attempt to access properties on null or undefined objects. This feature will implement comprehensive error handling, data validation, and defensive programming practices to create a robust application that gracefully handles missing or malformed data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to load and remain functional even when some data is missing or malformed, so that I can still browse available petting zoos without encountering crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display content without crashing due to null reference errors
2. WHEN data is missing or null THEN the system SHALL provide fallback values or graceful degradation
3. WHEN components receive invalid props THEN they SHALL render safely with appropriate error states
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages instead of crashing

### Requirement 2: Data Validation and Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all data to be validated before being used in components, so that null reference errors are prevented at the source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching data from Sanity THEN the system SHALL validate data structure before passing to components
2. WHEN components receive props THEN they SHALL validate required properties exist before accessing them
3. WHEN processing arrays THEN the system SHALL ensure they are valid arrays before iteration
4. WHEN accessing nested object properties THEN the system SHALL use safe property access patterns
5. WHEN image URLs are generated THEN the system SHALL handle missing image data gracefully

### Requirement 3: Error Boundary Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see helpful error messages and recovery options when something goes wrong, so that I can continue using the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component error occurs THEN the error boundary SHALL display a user-friendly message
2. WHEN an error is caught THEN the system SHALL provide options to retry or navigate to a working page
3. WHEN in development mode THEN detailed error information SHALL be available for debugging
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for monitoring and debugging purposes

### Requirement 4: Defensive Component Programming

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to handle edge cases and invalid data gracefully, so that individual component failures don't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components receive undefined or null data THEN they SHALL render appropriate fallback content
2. WHEN required properties are missing THEN components SHALL display placeholder content or skip rendering
3. WHEN images fail to load THEN components SHALL show placeholder images or text
4. WHEN map data is invalid THEN the map component SHALL display an error state instead of crashing
5. WHEN slug data is missing THEN navigation components SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 5: Loading States and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators and clear feedback about the application state, so that I understand what's happening when data is being fetched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
2. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL show appropriate empty states
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN retrying failed operations THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about the retry process
