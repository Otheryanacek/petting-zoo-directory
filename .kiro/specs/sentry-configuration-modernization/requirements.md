# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The petting zoo directory application currently cannot run in development mode due to deprecated Sentry configuration that causes the Next.js development server to crash immediately after startup. This feature will modernize the Sentry integration to use current best practices and restore local development functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Development Server Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Next.js development server to start and remain running so that I can develop and test the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run dev` THEN the development server SHALL start successfully without crashing
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL remain running and accessible at localhost:3000
3. WHEN accessing localhost:3000 THEN the application SHALL load without configuration-related errors
4. WHEN the server is running THEN there SHALL be no deprecated Sentry configuration warnings in the console

### Requirement 2: Modern Sentry Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Sentry error monitoring to use current configuration standards so that the integration is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Sentry THEN the system SHALL use the current `@sentry/nextjs` configuration approach
2. WHEN initializing Sentry THEN it SHALL use the instrumentation hook pattern instead of separate config files
3. WHEN building the application THEN Sentry build options SHALL be passed via `sentryBuildOptions` parameter
4. WHEN the application runs THEN legacy configuration files SHALL NOT be present or referenced

### Requirement 3: Error Monitoring Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error monitoring to continue working after the configuration update so that I can track application issues in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN Sentry SHALL capture and report the error correctly
2. WHEN testing error reporting THEN the monitoring dashboard SHALL function properly
3. WHEN in development mode THEN Sentry SHALL be configured appropriately for local testing
4. WHEN in production mode THEN Sentry SHALL report errors to the configured DSN

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring to remain functional after the Sentry update so that I can track application performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN performance monitoring SHALL initialize correctly
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be reported to Sentry properly
3. WHEN using the monitoring dashboard THEN performance data SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN Core Web Vitals are measured THEN they SHALL be tagged and reported correctly

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Sentry configuration to work correctly across different environments so that monitoring behaves appropriately in development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN Sentry SHALL be configured for local debugging
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the application SHALL handle graceful degradation
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN Sentry configuration SHALL adapt accordingly
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN all necessary Sentry environment variables SHALL be available
